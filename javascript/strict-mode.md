## Strict Mode
A way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript.

1. Eliminates some JavaScript silnt errors by changing them to throw errors.
2. Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.
