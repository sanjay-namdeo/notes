## React vs Angular
React is a Library, which is a **reusable** piece of code, which you can as it comes i.e. it does not provide any hooks for you to extend it.

###Single-page application
An app that works inside a browser and does not require page reloading during use. SPA requests the markup and data independently and renders pages straight in the browser.

### Multiple  Page App
Works in a traditional way. Every change displays the data or submits data back to server requests rendering a new page from the server in the browser.
