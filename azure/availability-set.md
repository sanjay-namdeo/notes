# Availability Set

An availability set is a **group of virtual machines that are deployed across faults domains and update domains**. Availability sets make sure that **application is not affected by single point of failure**, like the network switch or the power unit of a rack of servers.

> An availability set is a logical grouping capability of isolating VM resources from each other when they are deployed. Azure makes sure that the VMs you place within an Availability set run across multiple physical servers, computers racks, storage units, and network switches. If a hardware or software failure happens, only a subset of your VMs are impacted and overall solution stays operational.
