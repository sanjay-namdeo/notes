Angular provides built-in pipes for typical *data transformations*, including transformations for internationalization (i18n), which use locale information to format data. The following are commonly used built-in pipes for data formatting:

1. **DatePipe** Formats a date value according to locale rules.
2. **UpperCasePipe** Transforms text to all upper case.
3. **LowerCasePipe** Transforms text to all lower case.
4. **CurrencyPipe** Transforms a number to a currency string, formatted according to locale rules.
5. **DecimalPipe** Transforms a number into a string with a decimal point, formatted according to locale rules.
6. **PercentPipe** Transforms a number to a percentage string, formatted according to locale rules.
