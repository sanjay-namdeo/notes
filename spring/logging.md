# Spring Boot Application Logging
Spring Boot comes with added support for Log4J2, Java Util Logging, and Logback. It is usually pre-configured as console output. They can be configured by only specifying logging.level in the application.properties file.

```properties
logging.level.spring.framework=Debug
```
