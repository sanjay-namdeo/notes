## PUT vs POST

### POST

is `non-idempotent` creates a source and responds back with a URI to access that resource.

### PUT

is `idempotent` we have to send a request with URI. *If the resource is not found, then it will be created and responded
back with the same URI or else if present, the resource is updated*

> While doing a PUT request, we have to send a complete request, meaning all parameters to maintain idempotency; but in POST, we can send partial resource to update it with the resource identifier./

### Thumb Rule

**Use POST** when we do not know how to identify the resource and let the identifier be generated by the system (HTTP
POST /resource). Let the use know that the resource has been created by sending *201 Created* along with the URI to
access the resource (http://localhost:8080/resources/101). POST request can also be used to partially update the
resource by passing resource identifier and respond back with *200 Ok*

**Use PUT** when we have the resource identifier known (HTTP POST /resources/101) so that System will create with that
respond back with URI with the same identifier.

> IDEMPOTENCY It is a feature of maintaining a single state of the resource in the server regardless of how many requests are being sent to create that resource. For example:

```json
{
  "id": 12,
  "first_name": "Mark",
  "last_name": "Harris",
  "place": "Paris"
}
```

Even if we try to send **multiple requests** to create this resource, **only one resource will be created**. This is
idempotent.

Note: Partial updates can also be done by PATCH, which is non-idempotent.
