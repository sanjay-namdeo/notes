## Exception Handling

REST API developer will have two requirements related to error handling
1. Common place for Error handling
2. Similar Error Response body with a proper HTTP status code across APIs

>Both requirements can be addressed by using RestControllerAdvice annotation in Spring.

```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class ExceptionAdvice {
  @ExceptionHandler(value = NotFoundException.class)
  public ResponseEntity<CustomErrorResponse> handleGenericNotFoundException(NotFoundException e) {
    CustomErrorResponse error = new CustomErrorResponse("NOT_FOUND_ERROR", e.getMessage());
    error.setTimestamp(LocalDateTime.now());
    error.setStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND.value());
    return new ResponseEntity<>(error, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
  }
}
```

We have added one method `handleGenericNotFoundException`, which handles `NotFoundException`

Any service generating exception `NotFoundException` will come to `handleGenericNotFoundException` method.

We can define multiple error handler methods for different types of exceptions generated by services in the above class and wrap each using common CustomErrorResponse response. This will make sure that there is only one common place to handle errors and all services return similar error responses.
