## StringBuffer and StringBuilder
Both StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are used for String manipulation. These are mutable objects. But StringBuffer provides thread-safety as all its methods are synchronized, this makes performance of StringBuffer slower as compared to StringBuilder.

StringBuffer class is present from Java 1.0, but due to its slower performance, StringBuilder class was introduced in Java 1.5

>If you are in a single-threaded environment or donâ€™t care about thread safety, you should use StringBuilder. Otherwise, use StringBuffer for thread-safe operations.
