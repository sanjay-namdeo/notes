###String Pool
String Pool is possible only because String is Immutable in Java. String pool is a special storage area in Java heap. If the string is already present in the pool, then instead of creating a new object, old object’s reference is returned. This way different String variables can refer to the same reference in the pool, thus saving a lot of heap space also. If String is not immutable then changing the string with one reference will lead to the wrong values to other string variables having the same reference.

###Security
String parameters are used in network connections, database URL’s, username and passwords etc. Because String is immutable, these values can’t be changed. Otherwise, any hacker could change the referenced values which will cause severe security issues in the application.

###Multi-threading
Since String is immutable, it is safe for multithreading. A single String instance can be shared across different threads. This avoids the use of synchronization for thread safety. Strings are implicitly thread-safe.

###Caching
The hashcode of string is frequently used in Java. Since string is immutable, the hashcode will remain the same, so it can be cached without worrying about the changes. This makes it a great candidate for using it as a Key in Map.

###Class Loaders
Strings are used in Java ClassLoaders and since String is made immutable, it provides security that correct class is being loaded.
